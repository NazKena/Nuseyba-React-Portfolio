       <h2> About Me</h2>
       <p>I am an English and Creative Writing graduate who has recently found that a different career path may be exactly what is needed to spark creativity again. Coding will allow for that and so much more. I hope to enhance my skills not only throughout the duration of this bootcamp but through the entirety of my software development journey.</p>
