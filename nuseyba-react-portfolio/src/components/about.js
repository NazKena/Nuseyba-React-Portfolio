      <p>
        I am an English and Creative Writing graduate who has recently found
        that a different career path may be exactly what is needed to spark
        creativity again. Coding will allow for that and so much more. I hope to
        enhance my skills not only throughout the duration of this bootcamp but
        through the entirety of my software development journey.
